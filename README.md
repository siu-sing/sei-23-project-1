# sei-23-project-1
Project 1 for SEI-23

## Objectives
- Create basic Game UI with HTML, JS and CSS
- Practice DOM manipulation based on user input
- Develop algorithm in js replicate the snake mechanics

## MVP 
This was the original MVP plan I had at the start of the project:
- Game board maybe 100 x 100 units
- A “snake” (1 unit) to start on the middle of the board
- The snake is maneuverable by the player with arrow keys
- The snake can “eat the objects” (i.e. object disappears)



## Game structure - objects, DOMs 

## Overall Game flow 
## Critical Game Functions 
## Styling 
## Sprint Process
